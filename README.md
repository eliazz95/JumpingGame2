# Jumping Game 2

## Second iteration

This is the second iteration of the Running Game! I found yet another great [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pX7vlnG6eC8&list=PLZ1QII7yudbebDQ1Kiqdh1LNz6PavcptO&index=1) on how to make flappy bird in pygame and just like the first iteration I learned the basics and made my own game. Every class is divided in separate files now and everything looks a lot cleaner, I really felt like I stepped up my game here ;)

Moreover, i've improved enemy spawning! In the first iteration of the game the enemies placements were very poor and sometimes they would spawn on top of eachother. This time around i've improved the placement and also the speed increment. So about every 5000 score the speed increases and the distance between the enemies makes the game actually playable compared to the first iteration.

## Instructions
Pretty straightforward, just jump using space button and try to avoid the enemies! The speed of the enemies will increase about every 5000 score, so it gets very hard very fast! Good luck.
